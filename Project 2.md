# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Several projects (stochastic process) solved using monte carlo simulation

##Problem statement

The probability of triangle formed by joining three random points on perimeter of a circle is an acute angle triangle.


##Solution:The probability of getting an acute angle is  0.75535
